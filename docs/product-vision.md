# Product Vision Document

## 1. Purpose
**Why does this product exist?**

The idea from this project was born in a non-profit brazilian Jiu-Jitsu academy in a Rio de Janeiro faleva.

They are a small organization that organize local Jit-Jitsu competitions, and in order to 
organize those events there is a need to use a specialized software that is far 
expansive since we are speaking of non-profit in the favela that survives of few donations.
The mostly used option in the Brazilian market costs around 600 Reais (About $100).

So we decided to build a software from scratch to help this and others nonprofits or even paid
martial arts academies around all the word.

Working a litter more in that concept for the project we came to the decision of making it a
community where people can promote the events they are organizing and the teams and athletes can
sign up to those events.

**Why build something from zero?**

We think that by promoting an opensource collective product development we can motivate people
with different skills and experiences and new programmers that aim to gain real product and
collaborative work experience.
